Custom C++ project generator.

Essentially a very basic templating engine, designed to be run from the command line in a folder 
opened in VSCode as a workspace which copies and fills in some templates from a file into the current
working directory.

Made so I don't have to make a new bunch of VSCode config files and CMakeLists.txt from scratch every
time a make a new project.
